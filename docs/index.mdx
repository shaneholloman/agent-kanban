In a world where software engineers spend most of their time planning and reviewing coding agents, the most impactful way to ship more is to get faster at planning and review.

Vibe Kanban is built for this. Use kanban issues to plan work, either privately or with your team. When you’re ready to begin, create workspaces where coding agents can execute.

We're not a coding agent, but work seamlessly with a handful of the most popular options like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and OpenCode.
